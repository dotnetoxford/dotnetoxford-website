### Talk Description

_"I've been using Kubernetes a lot lately, and thought it would be fun to install Kubernetes on a cluster of Raspberry Pis. There will be real hardware, and we'll create a basic .NET messaging architecture using Rabbit MQ - run it locally natively, then with Docker, then we'll install and run it on our Raspberry Pi cluster._

_Along the way, I'll explain some of the core concepts and benefits of Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and message queues. I'll also explain how to install Kubernetes on a cluster of Raspberry Pis and discuss the hardware._

_This talk is suitable for both those who have never used Docker or Kubernetes before; those who have and are interested in installing Kubernetes on bare-metal; or those who just like Raspberry Pis and shiny things!"_
