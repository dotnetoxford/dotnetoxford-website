### Talk Description

_"Monolith applications are almost unheard of in today’s world, with most applications talking between a host of servers – whether micro- or macro- for data and functionality. A wide range of service layers exist for this, but .NET Core 3 adds first-class support for gRPC, Google’s preferred offering. In this session, we’ll look at how you can integrate gRPC between your applications – or to external gRPC resources – with efficiency and high performance."_

### Speaker Bio

_"[Marc](https://twitter.com/marcgravell) has been a remote developer for Stack Overflow since 2010 (and is somehow also still in the top 10 on the “users” board), usually working on the back-end plumbing for tools like SQL Server or Redis, with a keen eye on high performance and scalability with a C# bias. He is the author/co-author of multiple popular .NET libraries such as [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis), [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) and [Protobuf-net](https://github.com/protobuf-net/protobuf-net) and an active member of the .NET open source community."_
